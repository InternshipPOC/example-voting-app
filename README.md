## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

Located in `.github/workflows`, the pipeline runs **on every push** and does the following:

1. **Builds Docker images** for each microservice (`vote`, `result`, `worker`, etc.).
2. **Pushes** the images to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`).
3. Deployment is **manual** via `kubectl apply` from the `/k8s-specifications` folder.


## üîê Code Secret for kubectl Access to GitHub Container Registry
Before deploying, create a secret so Kubernetes can pull private images:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry ghcr-secret \
  --docker-server=https://ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=InternshipPOC \
  --docker-password=<your_token> \
  --docker-email=<your_email>
```
